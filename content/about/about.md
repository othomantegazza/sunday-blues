# The Sunday Blues Blog

One post each Sunday.

Sunday is the most contemplative and meditative day of the week.
It has a bluesy vibe, which mirrors best the feeling of this blog.

This blog is about genetic technologies, and about how those technologies are regulated and how they impact our life and society, through medicine, industry and agriculture.

I tend to be excited about technology, or at least interested about it. I know that technological development can be a resource, but also a burden to society. A great technology can cause massive harm if introduced with superficial policies that opens it to exploitation.

And this is what I would like to explore in this blog I want to explore the impact of genetics technologies on society. When do they help and when do they harm, and how policies and regulation can change the balance between the two.

I'll try to stick to this topic and discuss it in long argumantative articles.

Stay tuned (^_~)
