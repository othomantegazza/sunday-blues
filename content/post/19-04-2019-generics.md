title: "The Case of Generic Drugs"
summary: "Developing a pharmaceutical drug costs money, which companies must earn back by selling it. But medicines must be available to those in need regardless of their price. This is why government allow bioequivalent drugs; but can we ask for a better option?"

Pharmaceutical Drug research development has costs:

- It costs money, to buy and maintain structures and materials needed in pharmaceutical research, to cover for the pitfalls and dead ends that are unavoidable in the R&D process, and to pay and assure the well being of all people that work on it.
- It costs human intellect and human labour, because people focus their mental and intellectual force on it, and this process can be challenging and often unrewarding. And their physical strength also.
- It costs environmentally and humanitarianly, because research uses electrical power, it uses plastics and harsh chemicals, and above all, it involves the use and and harm of animals for our well being and the use of human subjects as tests.

How to justify those costs?
Once research is done, as a society we must make it worth.
We must make sure that the drugs generated by this research reach everyone in need. We must make sure that every single detail, generated by research, reaches those that prescribe that drug and those who take it, so that they know how it acts, when it is helpful and when it is not.

In Europe, this is governed by an interaction of multiple regulatory bodies at federal and state level, gathered around a key supervising and advisory Agency :the European Medicines Agency (EMA). This agency provides guidelines for drug research, drug evaluation and approval, and drug marketing. Many other entities are involved, including the European parliament, for legislation, innovationg and producing companies, and all correspective agencies and entities at the national level, which still have great freedom in the matter.

The monetary costs of R&D for new drug are generally recovered by a patent, which at the European level can by granted by the European Patent Office (EPO) and by the Data Exclusivity Period, regulated by the EMA. The patent allows market exclusivity for 20 years since the patent application itself is filed (a patent application might have to be filed years before the new drug is cleared for marketing). The Data exclusivity period instead lasts for 8-10 years since the new drug is cleared for marketing. Which of the two expires last, determines the timespan that the innovating company has to gain back on R&D monetary costs, afterwards the market is open.

The monetary costs are generally covered by a patent, and a right to commercialize the drug. In Europe these rights are awarded by the european patent office or by state offices.
