The European Union regularly keeps records of its agricultural holdings and of the people working on them; every ten years as a census and every 3-4 years as a random sample survey.

I've been exploring these surveys, primarly to understand how agriculture in Europe is distributed, I'm interested in two loosely related topics:

1. Who works on agriculture in Europe, how many people? Under which contract and which condition? What do agricultural policies say abot them? And, do they have say on agricultural policies? 

2. Which plant is cultivated in Europe? Where do the seeds come from, who controls the germlines?

But more on that later.

In the meanwhile, while searching Eurostat reports and datasets, I've found one interesting observation: In Europe there are 11 Million agricultural holdings and "only" 22 Million people working on them; 2 per holding, which is low. Probably, a big part of those holdings are small fields for personal or local use, which do not require workers for maintainance.

But, investigating this observation more in detail, could be a good way to start exploring what can we learn about agriculture from eurostat datasets. 

## Cultivated area and agricultural employment are decreasing
