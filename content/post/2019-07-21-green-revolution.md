The Green Revolution was a plant breeding and technology transfer operation during which, in the cold war era, the United States exported intensive agriculture first in Mexico and then in the Philippines and in India.

When discussing agriculture, the Green revolution is often cited both as a model that must be followed and replicated and, on the other side, as one that must be absolutely avoided. So it's not only a recurring topic, but a highly divisive one.

I wanted to write about this topic for a while now, mostly for personal reasons, to clear and organize thoughts. But, until now, I tried and miserably failed. Maybe because the Green Revolution is such a divisive topic, or maybe because its premises and effects are layered.

Although the Green Revolution itself it's a technology transfer act: a transfer of chemical and mechancal technology for agriculture, of how to use it and of plant breeds that were scientifically and systematically improved to yield more; the economical premises and the effects of this transfer are complex and layered. The Green Revolution represents a specific model of intervention, that was applied on something as crucial as agriculture, and that might be worth further scrutiny. 

The bad news is that, by writing this article, I somehow gave up once again. And instead of writing myself about it and trying to elaborate, I'll try to provide links to selected articles that I am using to trying to frame this topic. If you know other resources, I'd be happy to take suggestions.

# Norman Borlaug on the Green Revolution

Well, I guessed it's fair that first we should hear is the agronomist that best represents and architected the Green Revolution.

Norman Borlaug won the Peace Nobel prize in 1970 and for tha occasion gave a lecture that details [the motivations, the thinking and the actions of the Green Revolution](http://www.agbioworld.org/biotech-info/topics/borlaug/borlaug-green.html). 

He dedicated his life to the topic of agricultural development and afteward here I would like to suggest also [a second speech (PDF)](https://assets.nobelprize.org/uploads/2018/06/borlaug-lecture.pdf) that he gave 30 years afterwards, always as a Nobel Lecture.  

To propose a small critic, in both speech is evident a sort of technological positivism, approaching agriculture as a mere technological problem to solve. Both speech are also short on the social and antropological side, dismissing the single people that work in agriculture as a system to solve or as a mere instrument to agricultural success.

What I would like also to highlight is a tone of urgency that might come useful later. "We never waited for perfection in varieties or methods but used the best available each year and modified them as further improvement came to hand." 

# Critical analysis of social and economics impacts

Critical analysis of the premisies and especially of the effects of the green revolution are often higly politicized. Though I would say rightly so, since the Green Revolution at least shaped and exported an economic system.

A very detailed critique [was written recently by Raj Patel](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03066150.2012.719224), as a tool and as an argument to oppose a second one.

On a similar note, [Henry Cleaver wrote a radical critique of the Green Revolution in 1972](https://www.jstor.org/stable/1821541), right after Norman Borlaug won the Nobel prize. Although political, I would stronlgy suggest this esssay.

# Impact on communities

Kathleen Baker and Sarah Jewitt [traced and investigated the living conditions over 35 years](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220380601125180) in towns of the Indian districts of Bulandshahr, an area that was recipient of the Green Revolution's technologies. 

Their report is extensive and articultated. The observed outcome points toward a positive impact of Green Revolution technologies on the quality of life in the area. Though they point out that the gap between rich and poors is widening, since technological innovation is benefitting mostly the richer parts of the population.

On a similar topic, Andrew Flachs [provides a slightly more critical analysis](https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/JPE/article/view/20179) of the "top-down" apporach that characterized (but is not limited to) the Green Revolution.

# Urgency, Food Sovereignity and Food Justice

I have to admit that I did not have the change to read Vandana Shiva's book of the [Violence of the Green Revolution](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/278184.The_Violence_of_the_Green_Revolution), but want to add it to this list for it's relevance on the topic.

Calling back to the sense of urgency in Norman's Borlaug words, an urgency that indeed, when facing a famine, could not be easily dismissed, I would like to higlight another apporach that is worth considering from the Food Justice area. 

In the article ["What does it mean to do food justice"](https://journals.uair.arizona.edu/index.php/JPE/article/view/21076) Valentine Cadieux and Rachel Slocum don't talk directly of the Green Revolution but points to apporaches that could have been relevant to it. Their statement that "corporate and academic agro-science sectors sectors claim that justice is something that might be considered if there is time and inclination, but only after the issue of production has been confronted through techno-neoliberal strategies to 'feed the world.' It is therefore incumbent upon scholars and practitioners to make clear how it is, instead, socially just agri-food systems that provide food security and to show what makes those systems possible", must be considered.
