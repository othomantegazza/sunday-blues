title: "Who Submits Plants to the European Register of Variety?"
subtitle: "A sample of the european seed market"
summary: "As a rule, if you want to market seeds or reproductive material of a plant variety, you have to register it. Each plant variety must be registered as distinct, uniform and stable and must have a potential value for coltvation. The registration process has been criticized for favouring big companies, accentrating the seed market in few hands. I explored the European Register of Varieties to check which plant seed is allowed in the market and which company holds the rights."

I'm venturing in unfamiliar territories, so I'll try to document my research process, to make it easier to follow and to find the inevitable (and hopefully few) mistakes in my conclusions.

To reach my conclusions I've downloaded data from Eurostat and the Community Plant Variety Office (CPVO) and analyzed them. The R script that I've used to analyze those data are available [here]() and [here]().
