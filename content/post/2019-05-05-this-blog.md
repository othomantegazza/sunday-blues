A blog about genetics, a blog about life, a blog about how living organisms are used for our goods, a blog about biotech.

What I want to do with this blog, I want to explore how biotechnologies are used in Europe: who applies them, how are they regulated and by whom, who is part of the decision decision making process and who has been left out, what are the european plans about them, how biotechnologies have impacted our society in the past, what can we from the past about the impact of future research and regulation.

## Biotechnologies

When I say biotechnologies, I mean it in the broad sense. I consider it a biotechnology anytime some living organism is used as a technology for production and profit.
From the yeast making beer and wine, to plants that have been bred first by chance and then methodically to nurish us and to cure us, to animals that have been also bred, all the way to modern molecular breeding. From the use of microorganism to produce antibiotics, to their genetical engineering to produce more molecules, to the planning of a fully synthetic organism.
For fertilization of fields and farms, as nutraceutic, for waste disposal, to engineering of higher organisms and to human genome editing to cure genetic diseases and (maybe?) more.

## My position

I try to stay neutral. Technologies are powerful, and as the wise Stan Lee (^_~) says, with a great power, comes a great responsability. Biotechnologies can bring great good, but also cause great harm, especially to the most vulnerable parts of society, if someone is excluded from the decision making process, if someone excluded from the benefits, if the technology is forced from above.
Even in the best cases, technologies that have been applied with the best intentions might have caused great harm to groups of people and parts of societies.

To gain from technological research and development, we need dialogue and we need proper policies. More then ever in a complicated federation such as Europe, with the intrinsic diversity of meber states and its stratified decision and policy making process.

## Feedback

I have background. I have degrees in biotech, I have a PhD, I worked on genetics, genomics and genetic engineering. But somehow, regarding what I want to do with this blog, everything is new for me. When it comes to exploring policies, exploring the work of regulatory bodies, exploring the impact of technologies on people and on societies, and how different and less or more policing making process influence the impact of a technology, when it comes to this, it's all new to me. I'll leanr by doing, trying to provide you always the best quality information and resources.

The first post, the first year, will be of asseestment. You can accompany me in this process.

You can give me feedback, your opinions, your corrections, your questions and your critics. Anything is welcome. For now you can write to me publicly on [Twitter]() or send me an email.


One post every Sunday, to tend to your blues. to partner your blues.
