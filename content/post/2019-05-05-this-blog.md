A blog about genetics, a blog about life science, a blog about biotech, a blog about how living organisms are used for our own good.

Also a blog about the decision making process, policies and regulations, and how those policies affect and influence our life and our society.

What I want to do with this blog? I want to explore how biotechnologies are used in Europe: who applies them, how are they regulated and by whom, who is part of the decision decision making process and who has been left out, what are the european plans about them, how biotechnologies have impacted our society in the past, what can we from the past about the impact of future research and regulation.

## Biotechnologies and genetics

When I say biotechnologies, I mean it in the broad sense. I consider it a biotechnology anytime some living organism is used as a technology for production and profit.
From the yeast making beer and wine, to plants that have been bred first by chance and then methodically to nurish us and to cure us, to animals that have been also bred, all the way to modern molecular breeding. From the use of microorganism to produce antibiotics, to their genetical engineering to produce more molecules, to the planning of a fully synthetic organism.
For fertilization of fields and farms, as nutraceutic, for waste disposal, to engineering of higher organisms and to human genome editing to cure genetic diseases and (maybe?) more.

Essential resources come from biotechnological and genetic processes, the job and the well being of many people depends on them:

- The food that we eat comes form plants and animals that are bred on extensive genetic basis, and it is grown and treated and processed based on extensive biological knowledge.
- Industrial processing of common consumer goods employs often enzymes, and biotechnological products, which are often use also for waste disposal.
- Our pharmaceutical industry depends on many levels knowledge of the life science and on biotechnological processes for diagnostics, development, testing and mass production of pharmaceuticals.

And much more, our knowledge of genetics and our capability to manipulate it is growing fast. 

All of this constitutes a common resource and a common risk. 

## My position

I try to stay neutral. Technologies are powerful, and as the wise Stan Lee (^_~) says, with a great power, comes a great responsability. Biotechnologies can bring great good, but also cause great harm, especially to the most vulnerable parts of society, if someone is excluded from the decision making process, if someone excluded from the benefits, if the technology is forced from above.
Even in the best cases, technologies that have been applied with the best intentions might have caused great harm to groups of people and parts of societies.

To gain from technological research and development, we need dialogue and we need proper policies. More then ever in a complicated federation such as Europe, with the intrinsic diversity of meber states and its stratified decision and policy making process.

## Feedback

I have background. I have degrees in biotech, I have a PhD, I worked on genetics, genomics and genetic engineering. But somehow, regarding what I want to do with this blog, everything is new for me. When it comes to exploring policies, exploring the work of regulatory bodies, exploring the impact of technologies on people and on societies, and how different and less or more policing making process influence the impact of a technology, when it comes to this, it's all new to me. I'll leanr by doing, trying to provide you always the best quality information and resources.

In the first posts, in the first year, I will adjust my target, my main topics and my style, and to learn howw to communicate effectively. It will take me some time and some trial and error, you can accompany me in this process.

You can give me feedback, send me your opinions, your corrections, your questions and your critics. Anything is welcome. For now you can write to me publicly on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/othomn) or also by private message if you prefer.


One post every Sunday, to tend to your blues. to tend to your blues.
