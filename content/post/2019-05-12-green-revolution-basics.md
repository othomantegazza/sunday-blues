summary: "During the green revolution the developed countries exported the model of intensive agriculture in the rest of the world. Some argue that many were fed and saved from starving. Others argue that this model caused vast environmental and societal damages. For sure, the green revolution was a point of breaking changes in agriculture and society. Some that changes, we are still struggling to deal with today."

In the 20th century, the developed countries defined the model of intensive agriculture. This model is based on maximizing immediate weight yield by applying mechanical, chemical and genetic technologies to the field. Intensive agriculture was then exported to the developing countries starting from the 1950. This technology transfer effort is known as the green revolution.

It is a complicated and crucial theme, but also a key to understand the present agricultural landscape. 

While intensive agriculture was developed through the last century and is still being developed now, the green revolution is considered a breaking point: the green revolution is the moment when intensive agriculture became a dominant model. 

This is why I want to deal with it in this article.

# Key technologies

Three branches of technologies were applied during the green revoultion: Mechanical, chemical and genetic technologies.

## Mechanical

In the US, reviewed here https://migrationfiles.ucdavis.edu/uploads/cf/files/2010-may/huffman-paper-the-status-of-labor-saving-mechanization.pdf

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5217828_Agricultural_Mechanization_A_Comparative_Historical_Perspective/download

Mechanical technologies are applied in agriculture to plow the fields, irrigate, apply treatments to the plants, harvest, and process the harvested crops. Combine harvesters and tractors have helped massively increase the output of a field while drastically reducing workforce. This technologies appeared first, during the 19th century and the industrial revolution.

## Chemicals

Chemical technologies are mostly applied in two branches: pesticides and fertilizers. While the immediate effect of this technologies is obvious, the long term results are still being debated today.

## Genetics

The genetic part of intensive agriculture and of the green revolution is the one that I understand the best, and the most interesting to me (mainly because of my formation, in molecular genetics). 

Genetics technologies in the green revolution were applied in the breeding process to produce high yielding seeds.

In the 20th century, the field of genetics grew wicked fast. To give an idea, the basis of genetics were discovered by Mendel in the mid 19th century, but remained widely unknown until the beginnign of the 20th century, when they were confirmed and rediscovered. From the inception of genetics to the 1950, when genetics impacted agriculture worldwide passed less years then from the 1950 until now (2019).

Genetic technologies have been the latest, and came with better understanding of the outcome of plant crossing, and expecially with the conceept of F1 hybrids.

These are the three technologies that were exported massively during the green revolution.

# Famines and the Socio-economic landscape



# Cultural heritage and current issues

The main critique is about the economic and the social container in which the green revolution was applied. 

- Liberist imposition of technology: Cleaver
- environmental effects of pesticides and fertilizers: Double standards - public eye.
- Accessibility of hybrids. IFOAM
