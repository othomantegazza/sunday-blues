Author: "Otho Mantegazza"
draft: true
summary: "During the green revolution the developed countries exported the model of intensive agriculture in the rest of the world. Some argue that many were fed and saved from starving, other that this model caused vast environmental and societal damages. For sure, the green revolution was a point of breaking changes in agriculture and society."
