summary: "During the green revolution the developed countries exported the model of intensive agriculture in the rest of the world. Some argue that many were fed and saved from starving. Others argue that this model caused vast environmental and societal damages. For sure, the green revolution was a point of breaking changes in agriculture and society. Some that changes, we are still struggling to deal with today."

In the 20th century, the developed countries defined the model of intensive agriculture. This model is based on maximizing immediate weight yield by applying mechanical, chemical and genetic technologies to the field. Intensive agriculture was then exported to the developing countries starting from the 1950. This technology transfer effort is known as the green revolution.

It is a complicated and crucial theme, but also a key to understand the present agricultural landscape, and one theme on which I'd like to come back more in detail.

I'm not sure if we should consider as the paradigm shift point the moments in which intensive agriculture was developed, or later, the green revolution itself, when intensive agriculture was exported to the developing countries. But I'm more keen to consider the paradigm shit as the second point, since it brought worldwide, it expanded, and it exacerbated the potentials and the problems generated in the first part.

# Key technologies

Three branches of technologies were applied during the green revoultion: Mechanical, chemical and genetic technologies.

Mechanical technologies are applied in agriculture to plow the fields, irrigate, apply treatments to the plants, harvest, and process the harvested crops. Combine harvesters and tractors have helped massively increase the output of a field while drastically reducing workforce.

Chemical technologies came a little bit later, and are mostly applied in two branches: pesticides and fertilizers. While the immediate effect of this technologies is obvious, the long term results are still being debated today.

Genetic technologies have been the latest, and came with better understanding of the outcome of plant crossing, and expecially with the conceept of F1 hybrids.

These are the three technologies that were exported massively during the green revolution.

# Famines and the Socio-economic landscape



# Cultural heritage and current issues

The main critique is about the economic and the social container in which the green revolution was applied. 

- Liberist imposition of technology: Cleaver
- environmental effects of pesticides and fertilizers: Double standards - public eye.
- Accessibility of hybrids. IFOAM
