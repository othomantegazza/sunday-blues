One post each Sunday.

And not a particularly happy one, thus the bluesy vibes.

This blog is about technologies of the life science and of genetics, and how those technologies influence our life and our society.

I tend to read a lot, I tend to read a many posts that are excited and enthusiast about technological development, and many that oppose it.

I tend to be excited about technologies, or at least interested about them. But I know that technological development can be a resource but also a burden to society. 

So, I decided to try something different: in this blog I want to explore the impact of technological development - especially genetics and life science technologies - on societies. When did development help societies to grow and prosper, when did it harm them, and who, within them, have been harmed.

Moreover, I'll try to explore current European - and possibly worldwide policies - write about them, and discuss them.

Stay tuned (^_~)
