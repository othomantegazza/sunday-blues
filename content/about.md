# The Sunday Blues Blog

One post each Sunday.

Sunday is one of the most contemplative and meditateive days of the week. Sunday has a bluesy vibe, which mirrors best the feeling of this blog.

This blog is about technologies of the life science and of genetics, and how those technologies influence our life and our society.

I tend to read a lot, I tend to read a many posts that are excited and enthusiast about technological development, and many that oppose it.

I tend to be excited about technologiy, or at least interested about it. But I know that technological development can be a resource but also a burden to society. 

So, I decided to try something different: in this blog I want to explore the impact of technological development - especially genetics and life science technologies - on societies. When did development help societies to grow and prosper or when did it harm them, and who, within them, have been helped or harmed.

Moreover, I'll try to explore current European - and possibly worldwide policies - write about them, and discuss them.

Stay tuned (^_~)
